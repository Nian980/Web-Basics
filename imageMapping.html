<!-- ismap and usemap -->
<!-- 
    usemap is a lot like ismap and is more widely used. 
    ismap deals with server-side image-maps whereas usemap deals with client-side image-maps. 
-->
<!-- 
    Server-side image-maps: use separate map files that have to be downloaded. They depend on the server for translating the request. They also create additional network traffic. 
    Client-side image-maps: reside within an HTML document. The browser takes care of the translation (translating mouse coordinates clicked to corresponding Web pages).

    <!-- ismap is a boolean attribute i.e. its value is either true or false. 
        Thus, just the presence of the attribute indicates that it is a mapped image. 
        To be more precise, we say it is a server-side image-map. 
    -->
    <!-- An <img> tag with the src  and ismap attributes creates an image with the image 
        source file and indicates it is a server-side image-map. How will your code know 
        that if you click on a part of your image, i.e. 'Australia in a world map', it should 
        navigate to the country's Wikipedia page? We need to create a map file with these 
        details and then add the location of this map file using the anchor element.
