        <style> may be convenient, but best practice is have separate .css files

        <link> tag must appear in the <head> section. 
        Keep it in a directory called css.

        The <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.
        If the <address> element is inside the <body> element, it represents contact information for the document.
        If the <address> element is inside an <article> element, it represents contact information for that article.
        The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic. Most browsers will add a line break before and after the address element.

        Curtains forcing their will
        <br> against the wind,
        <br> children sleep,
        <br> exchanging dreams with
        <br> seraphim. The city
        <br> drags itself awake on
        <br> subway straps; and
        <br> I, an alarm, awake as a
        <br> rumor of war
        <br> lie stretching into dawn
        <br> unasked and unheeded
        <br>
    </p>
