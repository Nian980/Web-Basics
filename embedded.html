    <!-- There is one significant problem with iframes. 
        Suppose you create your Web page, containing only an iframe with src="http://foo.com", 
        with no borders, padding or margin. By all appearances, you would seem to be on the Web site foo.com. 
        If you don't look at the URL, it might be difficult to tell. For reasons like this, 
        some Web sites disallow their inclusion, so if you create an iframe with src="https://google.com", 
        you'll get a blank frame and an error message in the console. This isn't a bug, it's a feature. 
        Google and Yahoo do this for example.

    <p>This is a parent page that will host the iframe.</p>
    <iframe src="https://www.w3.org/">
        <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p>

        sandbox - 
        This can apply a number of restrictions on the iframe, preventing the site in the iframe from using pop-ups, 
    running scripts, automatically running videos and numerous other things.  This helps avoid some of the potential 
    security issues that iframes may be prone to. 
    -->
    <!-- Note:
    - Not all attributes are supported in all browsers.
    - Iframes load separately from the main page. However, they do block the main page's load command until its 
        content finishes loading. You can avoid this by applying some Javascript. This allows them to load independently. 
        Then, if the embedded page you are displaying loads slower, you can use your parent page to keep the reader occupied.
    - Great for third party content like ads.

    Disadvantages: 
    - Search engines have trouble accessing and in turn indexing the content in your iframes. 
    This doesn't help your search ranking.
